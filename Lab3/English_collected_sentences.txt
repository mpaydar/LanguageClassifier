In quantum field theory partition functions are generating functionals for correlation functions making them key
objects of study in the path integral formalism They are the imaginary time versions of
statistical mechanics partition functions giving rise to a close connection between these two areas of
physics Partition functions can rarely be solved for exactly although free theories do admit such
solutions Instead a perturbative approach is usually implemented this being equivalent to summing over Feynman
diagrams In a dimensional field theory with a real scalar field and action the partition
function is defined in the path integral formalism as the functional 1 where is a
fictitious source current It acts as a generating functional for arbitrary n point correlation functions
The derivatives used here are functional derivatives rather than regular derivatives since they are acting
on functionals rather than regular functions From this it follows that an equivalent expression for

The compound point is an obsolete typographical construction Keith Houston reported that this form of
punctuation doubling which involved the comma dash the semicolon dash the colon dash or dog
s bollocks and less often the stop dash arose in the seventeenth century citing examples
from as early as 1622 in an edition of Othello More traditionally these paired forms
of punctuation seem most often to have been called generically compound points and specifically semicolon
dash comma dash colon dash and point dash 1 2 3 Houston in his book
Shady Characters The Secret Life of Punctuation Symbols and Other Typographical Marks suggests that the
demise of this form of punctuation may be due to the emergence of hostile style
guides The Chicago Manual of Style launched in 1906 ruled against the dash hybrids from
the start except curiously enough the stop dash which was permitted only to introduce notes
