In quantum field theory partition functions are generating functionals for correlation functions making them key
objects of study in the path integral formalism They are the imaginary time versions of
statistical mechanics partition functions giving rise to a close connection between these two areas of
physics Partition functions can rarely be solved for exactly although free theories do admit such
solutions Instead a perturbative approach is usually implemented this being equivalent to summing over Feynman
diagrams In a dimensional field theory with a real scalar field and action the partition
function is defined in the path integral formalism as the functional 1 where is a
fictitious source current It acts as a generating functional for arbitrary n point correlation functions
The derivatives used here are functional derivatives rather than regular derivatives since they are acting
on functionals rather than regular functions From this it follows that an equivalent expression for
